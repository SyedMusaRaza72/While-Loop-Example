## 🧠 Logic Flow

### Registration Phase
- User must enter a username and password.
- If either field is empty, system asks again.
- Once valid credentials are entered, registration is successful.

### Login Phase
- User enters the username and password.
- If credentials match the registered values → Login successful.
- Otherwise → User is prompted again to enter correct credentials.
